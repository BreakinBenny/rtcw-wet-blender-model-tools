<P class="subtitle"><a name="intro">Introduction</a></p>

<P>This document is my attempt at providing some documentation on the MDS
format used in <a href="http://www.castlewolfenstein.com">Return to Castle Wolfenstein</a>.
It's totally unofficial, so bear with me if certain areas are a little vague or
inaccurate. Most of the information was gleaned by myself using a hex editor and
many nights of MAXScripting, but huge thanks go to Ryan Feltrin for providing me
with the crucial last bits of the MDS puzzle; Richard Crowder for getting me to
continue working on my MDS importer (as well as providing loads of help and advice);
and TiCaL for all his help. Cheers, guys!
</P>
<P>
I'm assuming you're familiar with the basics of 3D, Quake 3 mods, and skeletal animation with
smooth mesh deformation, so I won't cover these topics in much detail.
</P>


<P class="subtitle">
MDS In a Nutshell
</P>

<P>
So what's in an MDS file? The main things are:

<ul>
<li>A skeleton, or hierarchy of bones, some of which represent tags (as in Quake 3)</li>
<li>A number of triangle meshes, known as <b>surfaces</b></li>
<li>Animation frames in the form of skeletal poses</li>
<li>Runtime LOD data for each surface: the intriguingly named <a href="#colmap">collapse maps</a></li>
</ul>

Tags are simply bones named with the special
prefix "tag_" and work in a similar way to tags in Quake 3.
In RTCW, they are mainly used as mount points for weapons, ammo packs,
heads, mouths (for effects like cigarette smoke) and so on.
</p>

<P class="subtitle">
MDS Data Structures
</P>
These are the main data structures present in an MDS file:
<ul>
<li><a href="#MDSHeader">MDSHeader</a></li>
<li><a href="#MDSBone">MDSBone</a></li>
<li><a href="#MDSTag">MDSTag</a></li>
<li><a href="#MDSFrame">MDSFrame</a></li>
<li><a href="#MDSCompressedBoneFrame">MDSCompressedBoneFrame</a></li>
<li><a href="#MDSSurface">MDSSurface</a></li>
<li><a href="#MDSVertex">MDSVertex</a></li>
<li><a href="#MDSWeight">MDSWeight</a></li>
<li><a href="#MDSTriangle">MDSTriangle</a></li>
</ul>

<P>
I've used a C/C++ like notation with
explicitly sized types for clarity.
For example, <b>uint32</b> is a 32-bit unsigned integer,
<b>sint16</b> is a signed 16-bit integer and so on.
<b>floats</b> are assumed to be 32 bits in size, and <b>chars</b> 8-bits.

Note that as there are some hard <a href="#limits">limits</a>
on the numbers of certain structures, so the unsigned/signed distinction is probably overkill.

A bone keyframe that defines position and orientation per frame.
The first 3 entries in the <b>angles</b> array are stored in (pitch, yaw, roll) order.
The 4th entry is just padding and can be safely ignored (it's typically set to zero anyway).
The <b>offsetAngles</b> are stored in (pitch, yaw) order.
</p>

<P>
In RTCW, pitch, yaw and roll are defined assuming that +X is forward, -Y is right and +Z
is up, with right handed rotations. For example, a positive pitch will tilt down towards -Z.
To convert the compressed 16-bit angles into degrees, simply scale them by <b>360.0 / 65536.0</b>.
</p>

<P>
To obtain the origin of the bone's local coordinate system, create a rotation matrix from <b>offsetAngles</b>
using its pitch and yaw values. Construct a 3D point with
the <b>parentDist</b> value stored in the bone's <a href="#MDSBone">MDSBone</a> structure as the
x component, with y and z components set to zero (ie. [<b>parentDist</b>, 0, 0]).
Transform this point using the <b>offsetAngles</b> rotation matrix and
add it to the bone's parent's origin to get the bone's own origin. If the bone
has no parent, use the <b>parentOffset</b> coordinate stored in the <a href="#MDSBoneFrame">MDSBoneFrame</a>
for this frame in place of the parent's origin.
</p>

<p>
To correctly orient the bone, construct its rotation matrix from <b>angles</b> using the roll, pitch and
yaw (in that order) values. Together with the bone origin, this rotation matrix defines the bone's coordinate
system for the current frame.
</p>

<P>Take a look at <b>MDSData.ms</b> and <b>MDSLoader.ms</b> in my MDS Importer to see how I managed
to load the bone information into gmax/max.</P>

<P>
A surface is a triangle mesh rendered using a single shader. Each surface
has its own collection of <a href="#MDSVertex">vertices</a> (each <a href="MDSWeight">
influenced by one or more bones</a>) and <a href="#MDSTriangle">triangles</a>.
The bone references <i>aren't</i> indexed by the <a href="#MDSWeight">MDSWeight</a>
structures, which instead index into the main bone list.
The bone refs provide a list of all the bones referenced by a surface's <a href="#MDSWeight">MDSWeight</a>
structures, which is often less than the total number of bones in the model.
</P>
<P>
The <a href="#colmap">collapse map</a> is a list of target vertices for each surface
vertex. The mapping from a mesh vertex to a target vertex defines an edge collapse.
By successively collapsing edges and removing triangles that become degenerate after
these collapses, the surface can be simplified automatically. It's also possible
to go the other way, adding triangles right back up to the original full level of
detail. This is known as a progressive mesh system and is used by RTCW to dynamically
adjust the individual levels of detail for all onscreen MDS models whilst the game
is running. See the <a href="#colmap">collapse map</a> section for a few more details on
this dead funky technique.
</P>
<P>
The <b>minLod</b> is likely to be the lowest possible detail level. This is the point
in the collapse map at which the engine should stop edge collapsing to prevent the
mesh becoming noticeably distorted, even when in the distance.

<P>
There is an MDSWeight structure for every bone that has some influence over a vertex.
Bones with higher <b>weights</b> have more influence over the final position of a vertex
during animation. For example, a <b>weight</b> of 1.0 will mean the corresponding bone
(indicated by <b>boneIndex</b>) totally defines the position of the vertex.
The <b>weight</b> values stored in each MDSWeight for a single vertex should all sum to 1.0.
</p>
<P>
If you want to know more about how the smooth mesh deformation process works, check out Game Programming Gems I
for some good articles. Also, have a look at the function "SkinBaseSurfaces" in the <b>MDSLoader.ms</b> MAXScript
from my MDS Importer where I manually 'skin' the initial base pose mesh before handing it over to the Skin modifier
to do the rest of the work.

<p class="subtitle"><a name="colmap">The Collapse Map</a></p>

<P>
Here are some ramblings on the collapse map structure that might be of use:
</P>

<P>
The collapse map (as introduced <a href="#MDSSurface">here</a>) is used for runtime
dynamic LOD (level of detail) adjustment.
In Quake 3, separate models where switched between according to the estimated
on-screen size of each player model. The system used in Wolfenstein automatically adjusts
the triangle count of the model up and down as its on-screen size changes without requiring
any additional models! Cool, eh?
<P>

<P>
Models that can have their detail adjusted by edge collapses (and the opposite, vertex splits)
are known as progressive meshes. Technically, RTCW uses view-independent
progressive meshes or VIPM as it's known to its friends.
The particular variant
used in RTCW is based on the one described by Stan Melax
in his polygon reduction article, which you can find
<a href="http://www.melax.com/polychop/">on his web site</a> along with example
programs and source.
</P>

<P>
There has been a lot written on progressive meshes in the last few years, and I'd recommend
you consult Game Programming Gems I and II for some great articles by Jan Svarovsky
and Tom Forsyth on the topic. Charles Bloom also has some very interesting VIPM notes
<a href="http://www.cbloom.com">on his web site</a>. Finally, if you
don't mind academic papers, the relevant work
by <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~hoppe/">Hugues Hoppe</a> is
essential reading.
</p>

<P>
Creating the collapse map involves picking the edge collapse that causes the least visible
difference, doing the collapse and repeating with the remaining edges until the mesh
cannot be simplified any more. Once all the collapses are done, the mesh vertices are
sorted into collapse order (last one to be collapsed is first) and the collapse map
is written out. It would be far too time consuming to manually pick the edge collapses
in the best order, so this process is done automatically by the MDS build tool. A fully
featured exporter is free to choose edge collapses in any order, but for best results
some time should be spent on developing a good error metric.
</p>


<p class="subtitle"><a name="polycounts">Polygon Counts</a></p>

<P>
As a rough guide, here are total poly counts for some MDS models:
<ul>
<li>Helga: 1246</li>
<li>Trench: 1162</li>
<li>ProtoSolider: 2601</li>
<li>Venom: 1656</li>
<li>Multi: 1268</li>
</ul>
1250 tris seems about typical for an average player model.
