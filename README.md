# RtCW/ET Model tools for Blender

## Introduction

This addon adds support for MD3, MDC, MDS, MDM/MDX and TAG file formats for the 3D modeling software Blender. These file formats make up parts of the game assets for Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.

## Features

Its main features are:

* Import/Export of all formats
* Direct Conversion with certain limitations due to the nature of the formats

But there is also:

* Attachment of external models to tag objects in Blender, for example by using .skin files
* Shading by material names or .skin files of mesh objects in Blender
* Exctracting PK3 files so the contained data can be used by the tool

## Background

This addon is part of my ongoing studies of 3D model formats. It first started with creating Import/Export-Addons for MDC and MDM/MDX for Blender. As there were also requests to add support for the very similar model format MDS, i decided to make a unified addon including MD3. This is the result.
