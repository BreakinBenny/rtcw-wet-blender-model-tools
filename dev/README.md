Things for my dev process.

This repository contains:
* **export** directory for all exported models. Install scripts will search this directory for models to install.
* **import** directory for all import models (original game files and test models)
* **install** directory which contains all files which are zipped up and copied to the game installation path. Contains scripts to quickly test exported models inside the game.
* **pure** directory which contains all original model related files of et and etl.

### Prerequisites

* You need 7-Zip to run the install scripts.
